# Social Media Project

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


FriendRequest Model:

Stores friend requests sent between users.
Fields:
sender: The user who sends the friend request.
receiver: The user who receives the friend request.
timestamp: Automatically records when the request was created.
status: The current status of the friend request, with choices ('pending', 'accepted', 'rejected').
Constraints:
unique_together: Ensures that a user cannot send multiple friend requests to the same person.
Friendship Model:

Represents a friendship between two users.
Fields:
user1 and user2: The two users in the friendship.
created_at: Timestamp for when the friendship was created.
Constraints:
unique_together: Ensures that the same friendship is not duplicated.
Ordering:
Orders the friendships based on their creation date.
UserList & UserRetrieveUpdateDestroy:

Standard CRUD operations for the User model.
Permissions:
Both UserList and UserRetrieveUpdateDestroy use AllowAny, allowing unrestricted access for now.
UserListCreate enables listing all users or creating a new user.
UserRetrieveUpdateDestroy enables retrieving, updating, or deleting specific user records.
Authentication Views:

SignupView:
Handles user registration.
Creates a new user, generates an authentication token, and returns the user data along with the token.
LoginView:
Authenticates users based on their credentials and returns a token and user data.
LogoutView:
Deletes the userâ€™s authentication token, effectively logging the user out.
Friend Request Handling:

SendFriendRequestView:
Allows authenticated users to send friend requests.
Includes validation checks to prevent sending requests to non-existent users or to oneself, and avoids duplicate friend requests.
The request status is set to 'pending' initially.
User Search with Pagination:

UserListSearchView:
Allows searching for users by username or email.
Pagination ensures that the search results are returned in pages, with each page containing up to 5 results.
search_fields: Limits search to usernames and email addresses, with case-sensitive search.
In summary:
The code provides a REST API to manage user registration, login, logout, and CRUD operations for users. It also supports sending friend requests, managing friendships, and searching for users with pagination. The use of DRFâ€™s built-in generics makes it easier to handle standard operations, while custom views and validation help manage the applicationâ€™s unique needs like sending friend requests.

Base Image: Uses the python:3.11 image.
Environment Variable: Sets PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 to ensure that Python output is sent straight to the terminal.
Working Directory: Sets the working directory to /socialproject.
Requirements: Copies requirements.txt and installs the dependencies.
Code: Copies the project files to the container.
Expose Port: Exposes port 8000.
Command: Runs the Django development server on 0.0.0.0:8000.
